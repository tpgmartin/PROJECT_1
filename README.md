# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Portal Project

## Overview

### Description

This repo contains the first project completed as part of General Assembly's December 2013 - March 2014 Web Development Immersive course.

The objective was to create a simple game website, which would allow users to signup and challenge other (human!) players to games of tic-tac-toe. Furthermore, the user would be able to track their games and their current opponents. 

The biggest challenge in this project was getting comfortable with the game logic and placing that within the Rails framework.
